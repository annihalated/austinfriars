nihalsahu.net is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). The mailing list uses [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com). For analytics, I use [One Dollar Stats](https://onedollarstats.com/analytics). The design is almost entirely inspired by [benkuhn.net](https://benkuhn.net) (probably the best reading experience on the internet).
