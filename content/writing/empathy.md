> “To define force—it is that x that turns anybody who is subjected to it into a thing... It is the soul of the person it crushes which is transformed; it is killed, turned into stone, made into matter.” 

*Simone Weil, The Iliad, or The Poem of Force*

There is a home somewhere that must be demolished to widen a road. It has two floors, and it is in a thickly populated neighbourhood. The roads are narrow, too narrow to avoid perpetual traffic. Three generations live here. As you walk in, you gingerly close the gate, to avoid a resounding clanging. In the monsoons, you can hear the droplets thrash with particular agony against the floor of the verandah.

For the eldest granddaughter, who is showing you around, it is important to tell you stories, while reminding you with every other tale that it will never be enough, that you will never understand how much has happened here. The dust motes in the air were there then, dancing in the fluorescent light, as she went to school in the morning many years ago, as her father received the news of his impending absence. In this hall, her parents had arguments of quiet desperation—about the positioning of the furniture, about planning for several futures, about children and loneliness—as she hid in the terrace, trying to silence her mind, quietly pleading with it.

She stops, changing the subject rapidly, as her mother emerges and offers you coffee with a warm, unyielding insistence. You see her grandparents smile politely as you walk by, and you turn around and you look back at the girl’s eyes, and sharply acquire, for a fleeting moment, the experience of a length of years spent in simultaneous agony and calm. You look down, and see that what you took first for the floor was the water’s rippled surface, with its gulping disturbances, and realise, with fear, that they are a drowning girl’s anxious gasps as she kicks towards the light. You come into contact, for the first time, with the iridescent richness of another human experience and realise, with a pang of gratitude, the sheer mercy contained in the vagueness of memory and in the inadequacy of language.

We should be grateful for abstractions. We are lucky not to be able to truly understand each other, to only experience other lives through pitifully insufficient words. This allows us to do our jobs and play our roles. 

We could not build roads if we were paralysed by the agony of the inhabitants of the homes we demolished in the process. There are things that can only be done with some distance and some objectivity.

When decisions are difficult, and emotions are in the room, we tell ourselves that we must collapse experience into a series of questions that articulate a tradeoff: Are we really serving a public purpose? How many people will be affected? Can this road be widened with less disruption? Are there less damaging alternatives?  

We ask these questions with a grim earnestness. These are tragic choices, we cannot wipe away every tear from every eye, cannot ultimately address emotion and experience and grief.

Take medicine. The doctors have a harder job—they are too close to their patients—but they have proven themselves equal to the task.  

This is bad news for us, and also the crowning achievement of our race. 

It is our crowning achievement, because those closest to their subjects, with their hands wielding scalpels against their sinewy bodies, can abstract their lives away and subject them to cold calculations which will save them from death. 

But it is bad news, because it tells us that our effectiveness requires us to, at least temporarily, withdraw our empathy. In Atul Gawande’s *Being Mortal*, he suggests that the care of the elderly, and particularly of terminally ill patients, has been “overly medicalised, impersonal, institutional.” The problem is that doctors fail to ask and seriously consider the patient’s concerns and priorities and preferences: what do they want at the end of their lives? Doctors, Gawande argues, focused less on presenting the patient with options that maximised longevity, and focused more on what the patient wants. This is the fallacy of power, where the satisfaction you take in the exercise of your cold justness prevents you from being just.  To be just, we must recognise that we are not infallible, that we know precious little about the people we seek to serve, and so must listen. 

Researchers call this “acknowledging your positionality”—the social and political context of a researcher. We must start by acknowledging things. Yes, we come from extraordinarily privileged backgrounds. We are good expositors of the law and the public good. We are “exotic pieces of human capital.” But our inability to simultaneously empathise and be effective is an example of our human frailty. And we must act to overcome it, and acquire also the muddy strength to empathise with the richness of another life.
